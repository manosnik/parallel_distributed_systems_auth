# parallel_distributed_systems_auth
Contains 4 independent assignments from the Auth course over parallel and distributed systems
Unfortunately all the reports are in Greek but a short description about what the code does is provided here .

Assignment 1 : Calculation of number of triangles in a graph in series and in parallel.
Assignment 2 : Implementation of recursive data distribution function using MPI.
Assignment 3 : Running an Ising model using the GPU via CUDA
Assignment 4 : We will implement step-by-step a shared memory vantage point tree construction, given a data set of d-dimensional points X. The                      structure is used to perform the k nearest neighbor search (kNN) of the points on the vantage-point tree


In most cases compile instructions are given as comments in the beginning of the source files.
